# eggy example iOS (Swift) application

This is a tiny Swift application to demonstrate how eggy's iOS SDK works.

Build steps are provided below, but for comprehensive instructions, please visit [the eggy docs on push notification integration](https://docs.useeggy.com/push-integration/ios).

## How to build this

1. Make sure you have Xcode installed.
2. Open `hello-eggy-ios-swift.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Run the application from Xcode.

## To test this with your real eggy account

4. Make an app in the eggy console (from [Apps](https://useeggy.com/apps)), generate an API token, and copy the API token from your App detail page. Use this token to set `apiToken` in `AppDelegate.swift`.
